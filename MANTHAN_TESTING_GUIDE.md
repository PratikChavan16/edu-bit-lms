## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Mock Data)

**Remember, these use MOCK data for now:**

1. **Data doesn't persist** - Refresh page = data resets
2. **Delete doesn't actually remove** - Just shows confirmation
3. **API calls are simulated** - No real backend calls
4. **No real validation** - Some edge cases may not be caught

**When backend is ready:**
- Replace `mockData` with real API calls
- Remove `console.log` statements
- Add real error handling
- Add success toasts/notifications
