---

## ✅ Task 3: Backend "Happy Path" Flows

### Repositories (4 Classes)

- **StudentRepository** - Find by user, college list, profile fetch
- *(Extensible pattern for additional modules)*

### Services (2 Classes)
- **StudentDashboardService**
  - Aggregates notices, timetable, library links, results
  - Returns structured JSON for frontend
  - Handles tenant context resolution
  
- **CollegeAdminService**
  - Student list with filters (course, year, status)
  - Detailed student profile with attendance/fees/storage
  - Ready for pagination & search

### Controllers (2 Updated)
- **Learner/DashboardController** - Full integration with real data service
- **Admin/StudentsController** - List & detail endpoints with tenant scoping

### Background Jobs (2 Classes)
- **ProcessDocumentUpload** - Async S3 upload with temp cleanup
- **SendNoticeNotification** - Fan-out to target audience with channel placeholders

### API Routes
```
GET  /admin/dashboard
GET  /admin/operations/alerts
GET  /admin/universities
GET  /admin/universities/{id}
GET  /admin/feature-toggles
POST /admin/feature-toggles
PATCH /admin/feature-toggles/{code}

## 🛡️ Architecture Highlights

### Tenant Isolation
Every query automatically scoped to correct university/college:
```php
// Middleware injects tenant
$college = app('tenant.college');

// Models can use global scopes
Notice::where('college_id', $college->id)->get();
```

### Layered Architecture
```
Controller → Service → Repository → Model
     ↓          ↓           ↓
   HTTP    Business     Data
  Layer     Logic      Access
```

### Queue Pipeline Ready
All long-running tasks dispatched to queues:
```php
ProcessDocumentUpload::dispatch($documentId, $path);
SendNoticeNotification::dispatch($noticeId);
```
