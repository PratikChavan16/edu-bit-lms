## ðŸ“¡ Endpoint Coverage

### Core Health & Directory
1. **Health Check** â€“ `GET /api/test/health`
2. **Users Directory** â€“ `GET /api/test/users`
3. **Students Directory** â€“ `GET /api/test/students`

_All returned HTTP 200 with complete payloads (database heartbeat, user-role pivots, student-college joins)._ 

### Experience Dashboards
4. **Learner Dashboard** â€“ `GET /api/test/student-dashboard`
   - Verifies tenant + auth simulation, notices, timetable, and the new library/assessment widgets.
5. **Admin Student Roster** â€“ `GET /api/test/admin-students`
   - Confirms service layer filters and payload mapping for college admins.

### New Functional Modules
6. **Library Resources (Learner View)** â€“ `GET /api/test/library-resources`
   - Lists approved resources with uploader/approver context.
7. **Assessments (Learner View)** â€“ `GET /api/test/assessments`
   - Shows scheduled assessments and submission state for the student.
8. **Document Workflows** â€“ `GET /api/test/documents`
   - Returns required folders and uploaded/verified documents for the learner.
9. **Fee Management** â€“ `GET /api/test/fees`
   - Provides invoice summary including status, due dates, and line items.

_All module routes responded with hydrated UUID entities, relational data, and expected business fields._

## ðŸ§± Platform Integrity

### Database & Models
- 17 migrations executed successfully (core + cache/session + new modules).
- UUID primary keys and soft deletes applied across new tables.
- New models registered with relationships:
  - `LibraryResource`, `LibraryBookmark`
  - `Assessment`, `AssessmentQuestion`, `AssessmentSubmission`
  - `DocumentFolder`, `Document`
  - `FeeStructure`, `FeeInvoice`, `FeePayment`
- `Student` model extended with submissions, documents, and invoices relations.

### Services & Repositories
- Service layer orchestrates CRUD, filtering, and domain rules for each module.
- Auto-grading implemented for MCQ assessments via `AssessmentService`.
- Fee payments automatically roll up invoice balance/status.
- Document verification workflow records verifier identity and timestamps.

### Seed Data Highlights
- Library resource (approved) with faculty uploader and principal approver.
- Assessment with three MCQ questions and a graded submission.
- Admission document folder populated with an already-verified transfer certificate.
- Fee structure, invoice, and payment seeded for Year 2 students.

## ðŸ”„ Quality Gates
- Fresh install and seed: âœ… (`php artisan bitflow:setup --fresh`)
- Automated smoke suite: âœ… (`php test-api.php` â†’ 9/9 green)
- No runtime errors or validation failures observed during end-to-end sweep.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Ready vs. Whatâ€™s Next

### Ready for Integration
- Library CRUD (admin & learner flows, bookmarking, approvals)
- Assessment lifecycle (creation, question bank, MCQ auto-grading, learner submissions)
- Document management (folders, uploads, verification trail)
- Fee management (structures, invoices, payments, learner portal visibility)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Authentication Layer** â€“ Introduce Sanctum/JWT guards, session-backed login, and tenant-aware middleware wiring.
2. **Frontend Wiring** â€“ Connect Next.js portals to the new APIs, using seeded data as fixtures.
3. **Comprehensive Feature Tests** â€“ Add HTTP/Feature tests covering happy paths and edge cases for each module.
4. **File Storage Integration** â€“ Replace placeholder URLs with actual storage (S3/local) abstractions when ready.
