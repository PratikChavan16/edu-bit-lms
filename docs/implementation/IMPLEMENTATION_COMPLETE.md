## 🔒 Security & Permissions

All pages implement proper authorization:

```typescript
const { canManageUsers } = usePermissions()

// Conditional rendering
{canManageUsers && (
  <Button onClick={handleAddStaff}>Add Staff</Button>
)}

// Action guards
const handleDeleteUser = async (userId: string) => {
  if (!canManageUsers) {
    toast.error('You do not have permission to delete users')
    return
  }
  // ... proceed with deletion
}
```

**Permission Roles**:
- `bitflow_admin`: Full access to all features
- `university_owner`: Full access within their university
- `super_admin`: Full access within their university
- `principal`: Full access within their college
- `college_admin`: College-level management access
- Others: Read-only or restricted access

---

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before Error Handling Update:
```typescript
// ❌ Jarring alerts
alert('Failed to delete user. Please try again.')

// ❌ Blocking confirmations
if (!window.confirm('Are you sure?')) return

// ❌ Silent errors
console.error('Error:', error)
```

### After Error Handling Update:
```typescript
// ✅ Professional toast notifications
toast.error('Failed to delete user')
toast.success('User deleted successfully')

// ✅ Elegant confirmations
const confirmed = await confirmAction({
  message: 'Are you sure you want to delete this user?',
  danger: true
})

// ✅ Centralized error handling with user feedback
handleError(error, toast, { 
  customMessage: 'Failed to delete user' 
})
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Non-blocking notifications
- ✅ Consistent styling and positioning
- ✅ Auto-dismiss for transient messages
- ✅ Better error messages for users
- ✅ Proper error logging for developers
