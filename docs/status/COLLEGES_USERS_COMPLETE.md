## 🎨 UI/UX Patterns

### Consistent Design System
- **Color Coding:**
  - Status badges: Green (active), Yellow (pending), Gray (inactive), Red (suspended)
  - Role badges: Red (admin), Blue (faculty), Green (student), Purple (parent)
  - College types: 8 distinct colors for visual differentiation

- **Icons:**
  - Building2 (colleges)
  - User (users)
  - Users (students count)
  - GraduationCap (faculty)
  - FolderTree (departments)
  - BookOpen (courses)
  - HardDrive (storage)
  - Shield (roles)

- **Loading States:**
  - Loader2 spinner for async operations
  - Disabled buttons during actions
  - Loading overlays

- **Error Handling:**
  - Red background for errors
  - Retry buttons
  - User-friendly messages

- **Empty States:**
  - Icon + heading + description
  - Contextual messages based on filters

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication:**
   - Bearer token authentication (Sanctum)
   - `auth:sanctum` middleware on all routes
   - `role:admin` middleware for admin-only access

2. **Authorization:**
   - Role-based access control
   - Prevent self-deletion
   - Business logic constraints (cannot delete college with users)

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Password hashing with Hash::make()
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Soft deletes (data preservation)
   - UUID primary keys (non-sequential)

4. **Validation:**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Unique constraints on critical fields
   - Type checking and enums
   - Maximum length limits

Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'role:admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/colleges', [CollegeController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/colleges', [CollegeController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('/colleges/{id}', [CollegeController::class, 'show']);
    Route::patch('/colleges/{id}', [CollegeController::class, 'update']);
    Route::delete('/colleges/{id}', [CollegeController::class, 'destroy']);
    Route::patch('/colleges/{id}/approve', [CollegeController::class, 'approve']);
    Route::get('/colleges/{id}/statistics', [CollegeController::class, 'statistics']);
});

// Users Management
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'role:admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/users', [UserController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('/users/roles', [UserController::class, 'getRoles']); // Must be before {id}

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cd bitflow-core

# Run all feature tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test files
php artisan test tests/Feature/Admin/CollegeControllerTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/Admin/UserControllerTest.php

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage

# Run specific test method
php artisan test --filter=admin_can_create_college
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. **Add Routes** - Register API routes in `routes/api.php`
2. **Run Tests** - Verify all tests pass
3. **Database Migrations** - Ensure tables exist (colleges, users, roles, user_roles)
4. **Environment Variables** - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in frontend

### Short-term Enhancements
1. **Create/Edit Forms** - Build form pages for colleges/users creation
2. **Bulk Actions** - Multi-select with bulk approve/delete/export
3. **Export Functionality** - CSV/Excel export for reports
4. **Activity Logs** - Audit trail for changes
5. **Advanced Filters** - Date ranges, created by, etc.

### Medium-term Features
1. **Role Management UI** - Assign/revoke roles with visual interface
2. **Password Reset Modal** - In-page password reset without navigation
3. **Image Upload** - College logos and user photos
4. **Departments Management** - Full CRUD for departments
5. **Courses Management** - Course catalog and management
