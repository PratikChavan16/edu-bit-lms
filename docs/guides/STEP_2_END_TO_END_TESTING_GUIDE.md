## üìù Post-Testing Actions

After completing all tests:

1. **Document Results**: Update PHASE_3_TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT.md with findings
2. **Fix Critical/High Bugs**: Address any blocking issues immediately
3. **Evaluate Medium/Low Bugs**: Decide if they block deployment
4. **Update Production Readiness**: Recalculate % based on test results
5. **Plan Next Steps**: Decide between:
   - Deploy to production (if all critical tests pass)
   - Implement unified error handling (Step 3)
   - Fix remaining bugs before deployment
