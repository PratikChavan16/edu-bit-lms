## 📊 RISK ASSESSMENT

### HIGH RISK ⚠️

**1. Developer 3 Delays → Blocks Everyone**
- **Risk:** D3 must deliver auth & components early
- **Mitigation:** D3 should focus ONLY on auth + components in Week 1-2
- **Contingency:** If delayed, D1 & D2 can work on static pages (no API calls)

**2. Developer 2 Overloaded**
- **Risk:** D2 has 35 pages (most complex)
- **Mitigation:** Reassign 4-5 simpler pages to D1 or D3 after Week 4
- **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks

**3. Backend API Changes**
- **Risk:** Backend might change API structure during frontend development
- **Mitigation:** Lock backend API contracts before frontend starts
- **Contingency:** Create abstraction layer in API client

---

### MEDIUM RISK 🟡

**4. Bulk Upload Complexity**
- **Risk:** CSV bulk upload feature is complex (D2, Week 4)
- **Mitigation:** Allocate 3 full days for this feature
- **Contingency:** Simplify to basic file upload if time runs out

**5. Assessment Builder Complexity**
- **Risk:** Faculty assessment builder is complex (D3, Week 6)
- **Mitigation:** Break into smaller components
- **Contingency:** MVP version with basic features first

**6. Timetable Builder Drag-Drop**
- **Risk:** Drag-drop timetable is complex (D2, Week 4)
- **Mitigation:** Use existing library (react-beautiful-dnd)
- **Contingency:** Fallback to form-based timetable entry

---

## 💰 COST ESTIMATION

### Assumptions
- Developer hourly rate: $50/hour
- 8-hour workday
- 5-day work week

### Time Investment

| Developer | Weeks | Days | Hours | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|------|
| D1 | 7 | 35 | 280 | $14,000 |
| D2 | 12 | 60 | 480 | $24,000 |
| D3 | 10 | 50 | 400 | $20,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **12** | **145** | **1,160** | **$58,000** |

**Note:** Timeline is 12 weeks (parallel work), but total effort is 145 developer-days.
