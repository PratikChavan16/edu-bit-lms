## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** JWT token invalid/expired

**Solutions:**
1. Check if JWT keys exist in `backend/storage/keys/`
2. Verify file permissions (600) on private.pem
3. Check if `.env` has correct key paths
4. Regenerate keys if corrupted

---

**Issue:** CORS errors in browser

**Solutions:**
1. Check `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend `.env`
2. Ensure frontend URL matches allowed origin
3. Verify `HandleCors` middleware is registered
4. Check browser console for specific CORS error

---

**Issue:** Rate limit exceeded

**Solution:**
- Wait for rate limit window to reset
- Check rate limiting configuration in `config/rate-limiting.php`
- Admins can whitelist IPs in bypass configuration

---

**Issue:** Can't see data from other organizations

**Expected Behavior:**
- University Owners can only see their university's data
- College Admins can only see their college's data
- Only Bitflow Owners (God Mode) can see all data

**Solution:**
- This is by design (tenant data scoping)
- Bitflow Owners: Use organization selector to switch context

---

**Issue:** Bulk import failing

**Common Causes:**
1. CSV format incorrect - download template first
2. Duplicate admission numbers or emails
3. Department codes don't exist - create departments first
4. File too large - split into multiple files (max 1,000 rows)

---

**Issue:** Reports not generating

**Solutions:**
1. Check queue worker is running: `php artisan queue:work`
2. Check Redis connection
3. Verify report permissions
4. Check storage permissions for PDF generation

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| API Response Time (P95) | < 200ms | ✅ Achieved |
| Database Query Time (P95) | < 100ms | ✅ Achieved |
| Page Load Time (P95) | < 2s | ✅ Achieved |
| Concurrent Users | 1,000+ | ✅ Tested |

### Optimization Strategies

**Backend:**
- Database indexing on frequently queried columns
- Eager loading relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Redis caching for sessions and frequently accessed data
- Queue processing for heavy operations (reports, bulk imports)

**Frontend:**
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading components
- API response caching
