## 👥 User Accounts

### Admin Account
```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Access: Full system access
```

## 📊 Testing the System

### 1. Test Student Management
- Login as admin
- Go to Students page
- Upload `sample_students.csv`
- Verify 10 students are imported
- Try adding a student manually
- Search and filter students

### 2. Test Payment Recording
- Select a student
- Record an online payment
- Record a cash payment
- Verify payment appears in history
- Check receipt number generation

### 3. Test Admin Portal
- Login as admin
- Check dashboard shows all payments
- Verify cash is included in total
- Delete a test payment
- Confirm deletion works

### 4. Test Accountant Portal
- Logout and login as accountant
- Check dashboard
- Verify cash shown separately
- Confirm cash NOT in total
- Try to delete payment (should fail)

✅ JWT token authentication
✅ Protected API routes
✅ Role-based authorization
✅ Input validation
✅ CORS configuration
✅ Secure session management

---

## 📈 Key Differentiators

### Admin Portal Features:
- ✅ View all payments
- ✅ Cash included in totals
- ✅ Delete any record
- ✅ Edit any record
- ✅ Full system control

### Accountant Portal Features:
- ✅ View all payments
- ⚠️ Cash shown but NOT tallied
- ❌ Cannot delete records

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Payment Tallying Rules:

**Admin View:**
```
Total Collection = Online + Cash + UPI + Card + Cheque
```

**Accountant View:**
```
Total Collection = Online + UPI + Card + Cheque
Cash Collection = Shown separately (not added to total)
```

### Fee Calculation:
```
Pending Fees = Total Fees - Paid Fees
Auto-updates on each payment
```
