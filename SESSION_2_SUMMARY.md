## 🎓 Key Learnings & Fixes

### Enum Value Mismatches
**Problem**: Seeders used incorrect enum values  
**Solution**: Updated to match migration definitions:
- Library resources: `note` → `notes`
- Assessments: `midterm` → `mcq`, `laq`, etc.
- Submission type: `online` → `typed`, `upload`

### Foreign Key Issues
**Problem**: `graded_by` expected `user_id` not `faculty_id`  
**Solution**: Fetched faculty record and used `faculty->user_id`

### Model Field Names
**Problem**: Used `remarks` instead of `feedback`  
**Solution**: Updated seeder to use correct field name

### Priority 2: Complete Remaining Tasks (20-30 hours)
1. **Internal Chat** (12-15 hours) - Real-time messaging system
2. **Parent Portal** (8-10 hours) - Parent-specific features
3. **Faculty Portal** (10-12 hours) - Complete faculty features

### Priority 3: Polish & Production Ready (10-15 hours)
- Add more validation rules
- Improve error messages
- Add loading states to all pages
- Write unit tests
- Create user documentation

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Bulk Upload**: College ID is hardcoded in frontend (needs tenant context)
2. **Validation**: Frontend validation on bulk upload could be more robust
3. **Error Handling**: Could show more detailed error messages per row
4. **File Size**: 10MB limit might be small for large institutions

### Future Enhancements
1. **Progress Bar**: Show real-time upload progress
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Check for existing records before insert
3. **Update Support**: Allow CSV updates, not just creates
4. **Export**: Download existing data as CSV templates
5. **Scheduling**: Schedule bulk uploads for off-peak hours
6. **Email Notifications**: Notify admins when uploads complete
