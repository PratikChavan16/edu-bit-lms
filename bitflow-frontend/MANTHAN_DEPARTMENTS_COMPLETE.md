# 🎉 Departments CRUD - COMPLETE!

**Created by:** Manthan (Admin & CRUD Specialist)  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Time Taken:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ ALL 3 PAGES COMPLETE

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### **1. Departments List Page** (`/departments/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ List all departments across all colleges
  - ✅ 8-column table: Name, Code, College, Head of Department, Status, Faculty Count, Students Count, Actions
  - ✅ Search by department name or code
  - ✅ Filter by college dropdown
  - ✅ Edit and Delete buttons for each department
  - ✅ Loading and error states
  - ✅ Mock data with 5 departments from 3 different colleges

- **TanStack Query Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ['departments', searchQuery, collegeFilter],
    queryFn: async () => { /* Fetch departments */ }
  })
  ```

---

### **2. Create Department Form** (`/departments/create/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ 5 form fields:
    1. Department Name (min 3 chars)
    2. Department Code (2-10 chars)
    3. College dropdown (foreign key)
    4. Head of Department (optional)
    5. Status (active/inactive)
  - ✅ Zod validation for all required fields
  - ✅ React Hook Form integration
  - ✅ Separate useQuery to fetch colleges for dropdown
  - ✅ Success/error handling with mutations
  - ✅ Auto-redirect to list page after creation

- **Zod Schema:**
  ```typescript
  const departmentSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string().min(3),
    code: z.string().min(2).max(10),
    college_id: z.string().min(1),
    head_of_department: z.string().optional(),
    status: z.enum(["active", "inactive"]),
  });
  ```

### **3. Edit Department Form** (`/departments/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Pre-fill all 5 fields with existing department data
  - ✅ useParams for dynamic route `[id]`
  - ✅ useQuery to fetch existing department
  - ✅ useQuery to fetch colleges for dropdown
  - ✅ Pre-select college in dropdown
  - ✅ useMutation for PUT request
  - ✅ Same validation as create form
  - ✅ Loading state while fetching data

---

## 🎯 Key Technical Patterns

### **Foreign Key Relationship:**
- Departments belong to Colleges
- College dropdown populated from separate API call
- Mock data includes college names in list view

### **Form Validation:**
- **Name:** Minimum 3 characters
- **Code:** 2-10 characters (e.g., CSE, MECH, BA)
- **College:** Required selection
- **Head:** Optional field
- **Status:** Required enum (active/inactive)

### **Mock Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: "1",
  name: "Computer Science & Engineering",
  code: "CSE",
  college_id: "1",
  college_name: "MVP Engineering College",
  head_of_department: "Dr. Rajesh Kumar",
  status: "active",
  faculty_count: 25,
  students_count: 450,
}
```
