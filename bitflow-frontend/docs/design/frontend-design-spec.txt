Implementation notes
--------------------
- Each page spec includes desktop/tablet/mobile layouts; mobile nav swaps bottom drawer for left sidebar content.
- Feature flag references use codes from `feature_catalog`. If a module is disabled, associated components hide gracefully.
- Copy uses sentence case, avoids jargon, and supports dynamic placeholder tokens (e.g., `{collegeName}`).
- Accessibility: minimum AA compliance, focus outlines, keyboard navigation, ARIA announcements for dynamic content.

1. Design principles & foundations
----------------------------------

### 1.1 Branding & theming
- Primary brand (Bitflow default) uses `#1A56DB` blue, but each university or college can override via white-label tokens.
- Logo placement: left side of header for admin portals; top center on student/parent login screens.
- Theme tokens stored in `@bitflow/ui` and injected per tenant via CSS variables.

### 1.2 Layout grid & spacing
- Desktop: 12-column grid, 80px gutters for dashboards, 24px for content pages.
- Tablet: 8-column grid, 32px outer margins.
- Mobile: 4-column grid, 16px outer margins.
- Baseline spacing scale: 4px increments (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48).

### 1.3 Typography & iconography
- Primary typeface: Inter (system fallback: `"Inter", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`).
- Headings use weight 600; body copy 400.
- Icon set: Lucide icons tailored per module (finance, academics, communication). Icons stored in `packages/ui/icons`.
- Numeric metrics use tabular lining numbers.

### 1.4 Colour palette & state tokens
- Success: `#16A34A` (bg `#ECFDF5`), Warning: `#F97316` (bg `#FFF7ED`), Danger: `#DC2626` (bg `#FEF2F2`).
- Neutral greys: `#0F172A` primary text, `#64748B` secondary, `#E2E8F0` borders, `#F8FAFC` backgrounds.
- Focus outline: `2px solid #1A56DB` with 2px offset.

### 1.5 Accessibility & responsiveness
- Minimum font size 14px; 16px default body text.
- All interactive elements have 44px hit areas.
- Keyboard navigation order matches visual order; skip-to-content link at top of page.
- High-contrast theme available via settings toggle (`feature` flag `ACCESSIBILITY_HIGH_CONTRAST`).

2. Global UI elements
---------------------

- Modal dialogs: overlay with 480px min width (desktop). Primary button right-aligned, secondary left. Title in sentence case.

### 2.3 Forms & inputs
- Default input height 44px; label top-left, helper text below field.
- Sections separated by headings and 16px spacing; multi-step forms show progress indicator.
- Validation: inline error text in red with icon. Submit button disabled until all required fields valid.

### 2.4 Data presentation

- Cards: variations for metrics (with icon, value, delta), resource summaries (title, description, CTA), status cards.
