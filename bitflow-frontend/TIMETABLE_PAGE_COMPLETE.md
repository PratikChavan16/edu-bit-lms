# Student Timetable Page - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** January 2025  
**Task:** Todo #4 - Build student timetable page with weekly grid view

## Summary

Successfully created the student timetable page (`apps/learner/app/timetable/page.tsx`) with full API integration. The page displays a weekly class schedule in both desktop grid view and mobile list view.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Infrastructure

**Created API Client Hook:** `packages/api-client/src/learner/timetable.ts`
- React Query hook: `useLearnerTimetable()`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/learner/profile/timetable`
- Returns weekly timetable grouped by day with total class count

**Added TypeScript Types:** `packages/api-client/src/types.ts`
```typescript
interface LearnerTimetable {
  current_week: {
    [key: string]: TimetableBlock[];  // Day index (1-6) -> classes
  };
  total_classes: number;
}

interface TimetableBlock {
  id: string;
  subject: string;
  faculty: string;
  start_time: string;        // "09:00:00"
  end_time: string;          // "10:00:00"
  room_number: string;
  type: 'lecture' | 'lab' | 'tutorial';
}
```

**Updated Exports:** `packages/api-client/src/learner/index.ts`
- Added `export * from './timetable'` to make hook available

### 2. Page Components

**Desktop View (Large Screens):**
- Grid layout with days as columns (Monday-Saturday)
- Time slots as rows (08:00 - 17:00)
- Color-coded class blocks:
  - **Lecture:** Blue background (`bg-blue-50 border-blue-200`)
  - **Lab:** Green background (`bg-green-50 border-green-200`)
  - **Tutorial:** Purple background (`bg-purple-50 border-purple-200`)
- Today highlight with ring border (`ring-2 ring-primary`)
- Shows: Subject, Faculty, Time, Room Number, Type badge
- Empty slots show dashed borders with time

**Mobile View (Small Screens):**
- Card-based list grouped by day
- Accordion-style navigation
- Today's day has primary border (`border-l-4 border-l-primary`)
- Each class card shows all details with clock icon
- Empty days display "No classes scheduled" message

**Header Section:**
- Calendar icon with title
- Current month/year badge
- Total classes count in description
- Primary border accent (`border-l-4 border-l-primary`)

**Summary Statistics Card:**
- Total classes this week
- Number of active days (days with classes)
- Average classes per day
- Gradient background (`from-primary/10 to-surface`)

### 3. Features Implemented

✅ **API Integration:** React Query hook with caching  
✅ **Loading State:** Skeleton screens for header and content  
✅ **Error State:** Centered error message with retry button  
✅ **Today Highlighting:** Visual emphasis on current day  
✅ **Responsive Design:** Desktop grid + mobile list  
✅ **Color Coding:** Different colors for lecture/lab/tutorial  
✅ **Empty States:** Handles days with no classes  
✅ **Time Slot Grid:** 08:00-17:00 hourly slots  
✅ **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support  

### 4. Design Details

**Color System:**
- Lecture: Blue (#3B82F6 shades)
- Lab: Green (#10B981 shades)
- Tutorial: Purple (#A855F7 shades)
- Today: Primary ring border
- Empty: Gray dashed borders

**Icons Used:**
- `Calendar`: Header icon
- `Clock`: Time indicator in mobile view
- `AlertCircle`: Error state icon

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- `lg:block` / `lg:hidden`: Desktop grid vs mobile list
- `sm:grid-cols-3`: Summary stats grid
- `md:justify-between`: Header layout
- `grid-cols-6`: 6-day week grid

### 5. Data Flow

```
Backend → ProfileService.getTimetable(studentId)
    ↓
Returns timetable blocks grouped by day_of_week (1-6)
    ↓
API Client: useLearnerTimetable() fetches via React Query
    ↓
Component: Renders desktop grid or mobile list
    ↓
User sees weekly schedule with today highlighted
```

**Day Mapping:**
- 1 = Monday
- 2 = Tuesday
- 3 = Wednesday
- 4 = Thursday
- 5 = Friday
- 6 = Saturday

## Code Stats

- **Page File:** `apps/learner/app/timetable/page.tsx` - 272 lines
- **API Client:** `packages/api-client/src/learner/timetable.ts` - 26 lines
- **Types Added:** 2 interfaces (`LearnerTimetable`, `TimetableBlock`)
- **Views:** 2 (desktop grid + mobile list)
- **Components:** 4 sections (header, grid, list, summary)

## User Experience

**Desktop Users:**
1. See full week at a glance in grid format
2. Quickly identify today's column
3. Scan by time slot to find gaps
4. Color coding helps identify class types
5. Click empty slots to see time

**Mobile Users:**
1. Swipe through days as cards
2. Today's card is highlighted
3. Each class shows complete details
4. No horizontal scrolling needed
5. Large touch targets for accessibility

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with mock data:** Various class distributions
2. **Test empty timetable:** No classes scheduled
3. **Test partial weeks:** Some days with no classes
4. **Test different types:** Mix of lectures, labs, tutorials
5. **Test time boundaries:** Early morning and late evening classes
6. **Test today detection:** Verify correct day is highlighted
7. **Test responsive:** Switch between desktop and mobile views
8. **Test error handling:** API failures show error state

## Integration Points

**Navigation:**
- Link from dashboard "View timetable" button
- Link from mobile menu
- Direct URL: `/learner/timetable`

**Future Enhancements:**
- Click class block to view details modal
- Filter by subject or faculty
- Export to calendar (iCal)
- Print-friendly view
- Conflict detection
- Attendance percentage per subject

## Backend Requirements

The endpoint `/api/learner/profile/timetable` must return:

```json
{
  "current_week": {
    "1": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "subject": "Mathematics",
        "faculty": "Dr. Smith",
        "start_time": "09:00:00",
        "end_time": "10:00:00",
        "room_number": "A-101",
        "type": "lecture"
      }
    ],
    "2": [...],
    ...
  },
  "total_classes": 24
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Auth: Sanctum token required (`auth:sanctum` middleware)
- Student profile must exist
- Timetable blocks filtered by:
  - college_id
  - course_id
  - year
  - semester
  - is_active = true
  - effective_from <= now
  - effective_to >= now

## Design Consistency

✅ Matches existing design system  
✅ Uses Card, Badge, Button components  
✅ Maintains color scheme  
✅ Consistent spacing (space-y-6, gap-4)  
✅ Rounded corners (rounded-lg)  
✅ Gradient backgrounds for emphasis

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for QA and backend integration  
**Next:** Todo #5 - Build student assessment pages (3 pages)
