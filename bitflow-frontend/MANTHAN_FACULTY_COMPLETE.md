**Created by:** Manthan (Admin & CRUD Specialist)  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Time Taken:** ~45 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ ALL 3 PAGES COMPLETE

## 📦 What Was Built

### **1. Faculty List Page** (`/faculty/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Comprehensive 11-column table with all faculty details
  - ✅ Columns: Employee ID, Name, Email, Phone, Department, College, Designation, Qualifications, Experience, Status, Actions
  - ✅ Triple filter: Search + College filter + Department filter
  - ✅ Export and Import CSV buttons
  - ✅ Status badges with 3 states (active, inactive, on_leave)
  - ✅ Edit and Delete buttons for each faculty
  - ✅ Mock data with 6 faculty members across 3 colleges
  - ✅ Responsive horizontal scrolling for wide table

- **TanStack Query Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ['faculty', searchQuery, departmentFilter, collegeFilter],
    queryFn: async () => { /* Fetch faculty with 3 filters */ }
  })
  ```

### **2. Create Faculty Form** (`/faculty/create/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ **15 fields** organized in 2 sections:
  
  **Personal Information (7 fields):**
  1. Employee ID (min 3 chars)
  2. First Name (min 2 chars)
  3. Last Name (min 2 chars)
  4. Email (email validation)
  5. Phone (regex pattern validation)
  6. Date of Birth (date picker)
  7. Gender (male/female/other)

  **Professional Information (8 fields):**
  8. Department (foreign key dropdown)
  9. Designation (e.g., Professor)
  10. Qualifications (e.g., Ph.D.)

  - Department dropdown shows college name
  - Clear validation error messages

### **3. Edit Faculty Form** (`/faculty/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Pre-fill all 15 fields with existing data
  - ✅ useParams for dynamic route `[id]`
  - ✅ useQuery to fetch existing faculty data
  - ✅ useQuery to fetch departments for dropdown
  - ✅ Pre-select department and gender dropdowns
  - ✅ Date fields auto-filled with proper format
  - ✅ useMutation for PUT request
  - ✅ Same validation as create form
  - ✅ Loading state while fetching data
  - ✅ Not found error handling

## 🎯 Key Technical Patterns

### **Complex Form Structure:**
```typescript
// Two-card layout with 15 fields
<Card> {/* Personal Info - 7 fields */}
  <Grid cols={2}>
    - Employee ID, First Name, Last Name
    - Email, Phone, DOB, Gender
  </Grid>
</Card>

<Card> {/* Professional Info - 8 fields */}
  <Grid cols={2}>
    - Department, Designation, Qualifications
    - Experience, Specialization, Joining Date
    - Salary, Status
  </Grid>
</Card>
```

### **Advanced Zod Validation:**
```typescript
const facultySchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^\+?[0-9\s-]{10,15}$/),
  experience_years: z.coerce.number().min(0).max(50),
  salary: z.coerce.number().min(0).optional(),
  gender: z.enum(["male", "female", "other"]),
  status: z.enum(["active", "inactive", "on_leave"]),
  // ... 9 more fields
});
```

### **Triple Filter System:**
```typescript
// Search + College + Department filters
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['faculty', searchQuery, collegeFilter, departmentFilter],
  // Dynamic filtering based on 3 parameters
})
```

### **Mock Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: "1",
  employee_id: "FAC001",
  first_name: "Rajesh",
  last_name: "Kumar",
  email: "rajesh.kumar@mvp.edu",
  phone: "+91 98765 43210",
  department_id: "1",
  department_name: "Computer Science & Engineering",
  college_name: "MVP Engineering College",
  designation: "Professor",
  qualifications: "Ph.D. in Computer Science",
  experience_years: 15,
  specialization: "Machine Learning, AI",
  date_of_birth: "1978-05-15",
  gender: "male",
  date_of_joining: "2010-07-01",
  salary: 85000,
  status: "active",
}
```

- ✅ Triple filter system (search + 2 dropdowns)
- ✅ Date input handling
- ✅ Optional vs required field patterns
- ✅ Grid layout for responsive forms

### **Validation Complexity:**
- Simple text: `z.string().min(2)`
- Email: `z.string().email()`
- Phone: `z.string().regex(/pattern/)`
- Number range: `z.coerce.number().min(0).max(50)`
- Enums: `z.enum(["option1", "option2"])`
- Optional: `.optional()` suffix
