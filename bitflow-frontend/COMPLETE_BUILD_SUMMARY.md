## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Consistent Design Pattern Across All Modules:
1. **Statistics Cards:** At the top of each list page showing key metrics
2. **Advanced Filters:** Search + multiple dropdown filters (3-6 filters per module)
3. **Responsive Tables:** 6-12 columns with alternating row hover effects
4. **Status Badges:** Color-coded (green/yellow/red/blue) for quick visual identification
5. **Action Links:** Blue text links for Edit actions in tables
6. **Form Sections:** Organized into 2-4 logical sections with icons
7. **Validation:** Real-time Zod validation with helpful error messages
8. **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders and "Loading..." messages
9. **Empty States:** Friendly messages when no data exists
10. **Delete Confirmations:** Browser confirm dialogs before deletion

### Special Features:
- **Exams:** Duration formatting (minutes → hours), date/time pickers
- **Attendance:** Bulk marking interface, real-time statistics, radio button status UI
- **Timetable:** Calendar grid with clickable cells, view toggle, color-coded class types

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:
- **TanStack Query** for server state (queries, mutations, caching)
- **React Hook Form** for form state and validation
- **Zod** for schema validation

### Data Flow:
```
User Action → Form Submit → Zod Validation → 
TanStack Mutation → API Call (mock) → 
Query Invalidation → UI Update → Navigation
```

### Mock Data Pattern:
Each module has 5-6 mock records with realistic data for testing without a backend.

### API Integration Ready:
- All API service files created in `lib/api/`
- TypeScript interfaces defined for all entities
- CRUD operations scaffolded
- Filter and pagination support prepared

## 🔄 Next Steps: Backend Integration

### To connect to Laravel backend:
1. Replace mock data in all 33 pages with real API calls
2. Update API base URL in `.env.local`
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states for all mutations
5. Implement pagination for list pages
6. Add real-time data refresh
7. Implement authentication/authorization

### Estimated Time: 1-2 hours per module = 11-22 hours total
