## Ideal For
✅ Organizations with **strict air-gapped** requirements (defense, government)  
✅ Organizations with **skilled in-house IT team**  
✅ Organizations requiring **complete independence**  
⚠️ **NOT recommended** unless absolutely necessary due to high cost and IP risk

# OUR RECOMMENDATION: OPTION 2 (HYBRID CLOUD)

## Why Hybrid Cloud is Best for MVP

### 1. **Data Ownership** ✅
- MVP owns all student/faculty data (stored on MVP's servers)
- Compliance-friendly for NAAC/NBA audits
- Data never leaves MVP's premises
- MVP can backup data independently

### 2. **Code Protection** ✅
- Application code stays on Bitflow's cloud
- MVP cannot copy/reverse-engineer our IP
- Automatic updates controlled by Bitflow
- Sustainable business relationship (MVP can't "steal and run")

### 3. **Cost-Effective** ✅
- Lower hardware cost (₹9.8L vs ₹17.7L for full on-premise)
- No need for large IT team (Bitflow manages application)
- 5-year total: ₹3.42 Cr (vs ₹6.72 Cr for self-managed)
- Only ₹90L more than full SaaS, but MVP owns data

### 4. **Best Security** ✅
- Data protected behind MVP's firewall
- Application runs on enterprise cloud (AWS/Azure)
- Secure VPN tunnel (encrypted)
- Professional cloud security + local data control

### 5. **Easier Management** ✅
- Bitflow handles application updates (no MVP effort)
- MVP only manages database servers (simple)
- Automatic scaling on cloud side
- 24x7 monitoring by Bitflow team

### 6. **Partnership-Friendly** ✅
- MVP trusts Bitflow (data on their servers)
- Bitflow trusts MVP (code protected on cloud)
- Win-win relationship
- Long-term sustainable model
