**Total (incl. license):**
- ₹2,00,60,000/year ÷ 436,313 users = **₹460/user/year**

### Option 2: Hybrid Cloud

**AWS Cost:** ₹7,87,138/month for 436,313 users  
**Cost per user:** ₹18.04/month = **₹216/year** (AWS only)

## TRAFFIC & USAGE ESTIMATES

### Peak Hour Analysis

**Assumptions:**
- Business hours: 8 AM - 6 PM (10 hours)
- Peak concurrent users: 15% of total (65,000)
- Off-peak concurrent: 5% of total (22,000)

### Bandwidth Usage

**Daily Pattern:**
```
00:00-06:00 (Night):    5% load  → 2 TB/day
06:00-09:00 (Morning): 40% load  → 8 TB/day
09:00-18:00 (Peak):    85% load → 18 TB/day
18:00-00:00 (Evening): 25% load  → 5 TB/day

Total: ~33 TB/day × 30 = 990 TB/month
Optimized with caching: ~30 TB/month
```

### Request Volume

**Estimated Requests:**
```
65,000 peak users × 50 requests/hour = 3.25M requests/hour
Average 12 hours/day = 39M requests/day
Monthly: 39M × 30 = 1.17 billion requests/month

CloudFront: 50 million/month (cached)
ALB: 1.12 billion/month (dynamic)
```
