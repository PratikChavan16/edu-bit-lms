## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Admins:
1. **Bulk Import**: Use CSV upload for adding many students at once
2. **Cash Tracking**: All cash payments are included in your totals
3. **Full Control**: You can delete/edit any record
4. **Complete View**: See everything without restrictions

### For Accountants:
1. **Online Focus**: Your totals only include non-cash payments
2. **Cash Visibility**: You can see cash payments but they're separate
3. **Recording**: You can record all payment types
4. **Limited Edits**: Can't delete payments (admin only)

### For Both:
1. **Search**: Use the search box to quickly find students/payments
2. **Filters**: Combine multiple filters for better results
3. **Pagination**: Navigate through large datasets easily
4. **Receipts**: Every payment gets a unique receipt number
5. **Real-time**: All changes reflect immediately
