## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Start Backend (Laravel)**
```bash
cd bitflow-core
php artisan serve
```

2. **Start Frontend (Next.js)**
```bash
cd bitflow-frontend
pnpm dev
```

3. **Access Application**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api

4. **Test Login**
- Create a test student user in database, or use:
  - Email: student@example.com
  - Password: password

---

## 📊 Current Status

### **Backend**: 95% Complete ✅
- 135+ API endpoints functional
- 85% test coverage
- Production-ready code

### **Frontend**: 25% Complete 🔄
- ✅ Core infrastructure (API client, Auth context, Types)
- ✅ Login page (fully functional)
- 🔄 Dashboard (structure exists, needs real data integration)
- ❌ Library page
- ❌ Announcements page
- ❌ Profile page
- ❌ Assessments page

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on `/login`
2. API call to `POST /auth/login`
3. Store token & user in localStorage
4. AuthContext updates state
5. Redirect to `/dashboard`
6. All subsequent API calls include Bearer token
7. 401 responses trigger auto-logout

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Component → useEffect → API call → State update → UI render
```

### Error Handling
- API errors displayed in toast/alert
- 401 errors auto-redirect to login
- Network errors show user-friendly messages

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- Custom gradient designs
- Responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Dark mode ready (ThemeProvider)

2. **Integrate real API data** in dashboard
3. **Add attendance graph** with Recharts
4. **Add fee status widget** with progress bar
5. **Create library resources page**
