   - Checkpoint: Peer review + stakeholder approval

2. **Authentication Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Use battle-tested libraries (Sanctum)
   - Checkpoint: Security audit before Phase 12

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Lock MVP features in Phase 4
   - Checkpoint: Weekly sprint reviews

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Load testing in Phase 10
   - Checkpoint: API benchmarks <200ms

5. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Docker early, staging environment
   - Checkpoint: Test deployment in staging first
