# Bug Fixes Log

## Version 1.0.1 - October 13, 2025

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. Receipt Number Generation Error ✅
**Issue:** Payment validation failed with "receiptNumber is required" error
**Cause:** Pre-save hook was running after validation, causing the required field to be empty
**Fix:** 
- Moved receipt number generation to the payment route before creating the Payment object
- Receipt number is now explicitly generated using: `RCP${String(count + 1).padStart(6, '0')}`
- Format: RCP000001, RCP000002, etc.

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/routes/payments.js` - Added receipt number generation before Payment creation
- `backend/models/Payment.js` - Simplified pre-validate hook

#### 2. React Import Path Errors ✅
**Issue:** Module not found - relative imports outside src/ directory
**Cause:** Incorrect relative paths in import statements
**Fix:** 
- Updated AuthContext import in PrivateRoute.js from `../../context/AuthContext` to `../context/AuthContext`
- Fixed all component imports to use correct relative paths

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/PrivateRoute.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar/Navbar.js`

#### 3. React Hooks Warnings ✅
**Issue:** useEffect has missing dependencies warning
**Cause:** Functions used in useEffect were not memoized
**Fix:** 
- Wrapped fetchPayments and fetchStudents in useCallback hook
- Added proper dependency arrays

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Payments/Payments.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Students/Students.js`

#### 4. Unused Variables ✅
**Issue:** ESLint warnings for unused variables
**Fix:**
- Removed unused `navigate` import from Navbar.js
- Removed unused `FiEdit`, `FiFilter`, `FiDownload` icons from component imports

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar/Navbar.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Payments/Payments.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Students/Students.js`
