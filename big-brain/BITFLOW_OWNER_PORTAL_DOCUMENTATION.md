### **Authentication Flow**

1. User enters credentials on `/login`
2. Frontend sends POST to `/api/v1/auth/login`
3. Backend validates credentials
4. Backend returns:
   - Access token
   - Refresh token
   - User data (with roles, permissions)
5. Frontend stores:
   - Tokens in `localStorage`
   - Token in cookie (for middleware)
   - User data in AuthContext
6. Frontend redirects to `/` (dashboard)
7. All subsequent API calls include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
8. API client intercepts 401 errors and attempts token refresh
9. On logout, tokens are cleared and user redirected to `/login`

### **God Mode Implementation**

Bitflow Owner role bypasses all scoping restrictions:

- **Backend**: 
  ```php
  // Disable university scoping for God Mode users
  if ($user->hasRole('bitflow_owner')) {
      Model::withoutGlobalScope(UniversityScope::class);
  }
  ```

- **Frontend**: Can access any university/college data via API
- **Audit**: All actions logged with `god_mode_context` flag
