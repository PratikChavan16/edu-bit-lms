## üêõ Critical Bugs & Issues

### 1. God Mode Issues
- **Bug:** Bitflow Owners can only see data for one university
- **Root Cause:** Backend applies `university_id` scoping to all roles
- **Fix Needed:** Conditional scoping that bypasses filter for `bitflow_owner` role
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Estimated Time:** 1 day

### 2. Circular Dependency (Department ‚Üî Faculty)
- **Bug:** Cannot create department with HOD because faculty doesn't exist yet
- **Root Cause:** Foreign key constraint HOD ‚Üí Faculty
- **Workaround:** Create department without HOD, add faculty, then assign HOD
- **Fix Needed:** UI workflow that guides this process
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Estimated Time:** 2 days

### 3. Real-time Data Not Updating
- **Bug:** Dashboard shows stale data
- **Root Cause:** No WebSocket implementation
- **Fix Needed:** Implement Socket.io for real-time updates
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Estimated Time:** 5 days

### 4. Missing Form Validations
- **Bug:** Inconsistent validation across forms
- **Examples:**
  - Email format not validated on all forms
  - Phone number doesn't enforce E.164 format
  - Password strength not enforced uniformly
- **Fix Needed:** Centralized validation schema using Zod
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time:** 3 days

### 5. Pagination Issues
- **Bug:** Pagination breaks when total records > 10,000
- **Root Cause:** Client-side pagination for large datasets
- **Fix Needed:** Server-side pagination with cursor-based approach
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time:** 2 days

### 6. Session Management
- **Bug:** Users not logged out after 2 hours (per spec)
- **Root Cause:** No session timeout implementation
- **Fix Needed:** Implement Redis session store with 2-hour TTL
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time:** 2 days

### 7. File Upload Missing
- **Bug:** No file upload functionality anywhere
- **Examples Needed:**
  - University logo upload
  - Student photo upload
  - Document uploads (certificates, ID proof)
- **Fix Needed:** Implement file upload with AWS S3/local storage
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Estimated Time:** 4 days

### 8. Error Messages Not User-Friendly
- **Bug:** Technical error messages shown to users
- **Example:** "FOREIGN_KEY_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION" instead of "Cannot delete this item because it's being used"
- **Fix Needed:** Error message mapping layer
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time:** 2 days

### 9. No Loading States
- **Bug:** Users don't know when data is loading
- **Impact:** Poor UX, users think app is frozen
- **Fix Needed:** Add loading skeletons to all data-fetching components
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time:** 3 days

## üìù Notes & Recommendations

### Technical Debt
- Refactor form validation to use centralized Zod schemas
- Migrate from client-side to server-side pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper error boundary components
- Add comprehensive TypeScript types (reduce `any` usage)
- Set up automated testing pipeline

### Infrastructure Needs
- Redis instance for caching and session management
- S3-compatible storage for file uploads
- WebSocket server (can be same as API server with Socket.io)
- Monitoring service (Sentry, LogRocket, or similar)
- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar)
- SMS gateway (Twilio or similar)

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "socket.io": "^4.6.0",
    "socket.io-client": "^4.6.0",
    "redis": "^4.6.0",
    "ioredis": "^5.3.0",
    "zod": "^3.22.0",
    "aws-sdk": "^2.1490.0",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "helmet": "^7.1.0",
    "express-rate-limit": "^7.1.0",
    "chart.js": "^4.4.0",
    "react-chartjs-2": "^5.2.0",
    "date-fns": "^2.30.0",
    "xlsx": "^0.18.5",
    "pdfkit": "^0.13.0"
  }
}
```

### Risk Factors
1. **God Mode complexity** - Cross-tenant queries can be slow if not optimized
2. **WebSocket scaling** - May need separate WebSocket server for high traffic
3. **File storage costs** - S3 costs can add up with many file uploads
4. **Payment gateway integration** - Stripe/Razorpay integration can take longer than estimated
5. **Third-party API dependencies** - SMS/Email services can have rate limits

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement database indexes for cross-tenant queries
- Use Redis pub/sub for WebSocket message broadcasting
- Implement file size limits and cleanup policies
- Start payment gateway integration early
- Implement retry logic and queue system for third-party APIs
