## Portal Identity

**Super Admin** is the operational backbone of a university, managing day-to-day operations across all colleges. While University Owner sets strategic direction, Super Admin handles:
- Academic calendar management
- Course & curriculum setup
- Timetable creation
- Exam scheduling
- User account management
- System configuration
- Operational reports

**Key Distinction**: 
- **University Owner** = Strategic (Create colleges, hire faculty, approve budgets)
- **Super Admin** = Operational (Setup courses, manage schedules, configure systems)
