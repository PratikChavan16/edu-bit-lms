- Angular: Rejected due to steeper learning curve

---

#### ✅ **PostgreSQL 16 (Database)**

**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for critical academic data
- Excellent support for JSONB (flexible schemas)
- Advanced indexing (GIN, GiST, BRIN)
- Proven scalability

**Outcome**: Perfect fit. Complex queries perform well, JSONB saved significant development time.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MySQL: Rejected due to weaker JSON support
- MongoDB: Rejected due to need for ACID transactions

---

#### ✅ **Redis 7.2 (Cache & Queue)**

**Rationale**:
- In-memory speed for session storage
- Reliable queue system with pub/sub
- Easy clustering for high availability

**Outcome**: Excellent performance. Sub-millisecond cache hits, reliable queues.

**Challenges**:
- Memory management required tuning (eviction policies)
- Persistence configuration for durability

---

#### ⚠️ **Elasticsearch 8.x (Search & Analytics)**

**Rationale**:
- Full-text search for curricula and question bank
- Aggregations for analytics dashboard
- Scalable for large datasets

**Outcome**: Mixed. Powerful but operationally complex.

**Challenges**:
- High memory usage (required 4GB+ per node)
- Occasional cluster split-brain issues
- Complex query DSL learning curve

**Recommendation**: Consider Typesense or Meilisearch for simpler use cases.

---

### 2.2 Design Patterns

#### ✅ **Service-Oriented Architecture**

```
Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test (mock services)
- Reusable business logic

**Example**:
```php
// CurriculumController delegates to CurriculumService
public function store(CurriculumRequest $request)
{
    $curriculum = $this->curriculumService->createCurriculum($request->validated());
    return new CurriculumResource($curriculum);
}
```

---

#### ✅ **Repository Pattern**

**Benefits**:
- Abstraction over data access
- Easier to switch databases if needed
- Centralized query logic

**Challenge**: Can be overkill for simple CRUD operations.

---

#### ✅ **Observer Pattern (Model Events)**

**Use Case**: Audit logging for all CRUD operations

```php
class CurriculumObserver
{
    public function created(Curriculum $curriculum)
    {
        AuditLog::create([...]);
    }
}
```

**Benefit**: Automatic audit trail without cluttering controllers.

---

### 2.3 Database Design Decisions

#### ✅ **Soft Deletes Everywhere**

**Rationale**: Academic data must never be permanently lost (compliance).

**Trade-off**: Queries more complex (need `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`), but worth it.

---

#### ✅ **Denormalized `exam_results` Table**

**Rationale**: Analytics queries need fast aggregations.

**Structure**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE exam_results (
    college_id BIGINT,
    program_id BIGINT,
    marks_obtained DECIMAL,
    academic_year VARCHAR,
    -- Denormalized for speed
);
```

**Benefit**: 10x faster analytics queries (average 50ms vs 500ms).

**Trade-off**: Data duplication, requires sync jobs to keep updated.

---

#### ✅ **JSONB for Flexible Fields**

**Use Case**: Course prerequisites, learning outcomes, curriculum customizations

```sql
prerequisites JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb
```

**Benefit**: Schema flexibility without migrations for every change.

**Challenge**: Harder to enforce constraints, need application-level validation.

---

## 3. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 3.1 Challenge: Cross-College Data Aggregation Performance

**Problem**: Initial analytics queries took 8-12 seconds for 50 colleges.

**Root Cause**: Complex JOINs across colleges, no indexing on foreign keys.

**Solution**:
1. **Materialized View** for pre-aggregated metrics:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_college_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
    college_id,
    academic_year,
    AVG(marks_obtained) as avg_marks,
    COUNT(*) as total_students
FROM exam_results
GROUP BY college_id, academic_year;

-- Refresh daily
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_college_performance_summary;
```

2. **Partitioning** `exam_results` by academic year:
```sql
CREATE TABLE exam_results_2024 PARTITION OF exam_results
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

3. **Composite Indexes**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_exam_results_analytics 
ON exam_results(college_id, academic_year, program_id);
```

**Result**: Query time reduced to 50-100ms (80x faster).

**Lesson**: For read-heavy analytics, pre-aggregation is essential.

---

### 3.2 Challenge: Curriculum Synchronization Failures

**Problem**: When publishing curriculum to 50 colleges, 5-10 would fail due to network issues.

**Initial Approach**: Synchronous HTTP requests in loop → 30% failure rate.

**Solution**: Queue-based async processing with retry logic

```php
// Job: SyncCurriculumToColleges
public function handle()
{
    foreach ($this->collegeIds as $collegeId) {
        try {
            $response = Http::timeout(30)
                ->retry(3, 1000, function ($exception) {
                    return $exception instanceof ConnectionException;
                })
                ->post($college->api_endpoint, $data);
                
            if ($response->failed()) {
                $this->release(60); // Retry after 60 seconds
            }
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            Log::error("Sync failed for college {$collegeId}: {$e->getMessage()}");
            // Alert admin
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: Failure rate reduced to < 2%.

**Lesson**: Always use queues for external API calls. Implement circuit breaker for repeated failures.

---

### 3.3 Challenge: Question Bank Search Performance

**Problem**: Full-text search in PostgreSQL was slow (2-3 seconds) with 50K+ questions.

**Initial Approach**: Using `ILIKE` queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM question_bank 
WHERE question_text ILIKE '%normalization%';
```

**Solution 1**: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search with GIN index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_question_bank_fts 
ON question_bank USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', question_text));

-- Query
SELECT * FROM question_bank 
WHERE to_tsvector('english', question_text) @@ to_tsquery('normalization');
```

**Result**: Improved to 200-300ms.

**Solution 2**: Migrated to Elasticsearch for advanced features
```php
$results = $elasticsearchClient->search([
    'index' => 'question_bank',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'multi_match' => [
                'query' => 'normalization',
                'fields' => ['question_text^3', 'topic', 'explanation'],
                'fuzziness' => 'AUTO',
            ],
        ],
    ],
]);
```

**Result**: 50-100ms with fuzzy matching and relevance ranking.

**Lesson**: PostgreSQL FTS is good for basic search. Use Elasticsearch for advanced features (fuzzy, facets, highlighting).

---

### 3.4 Challenge: Real-Time Approval Notifications

**Problem**: Users didn't know when their approval requests were reviewed.

**Initial Approach**: Email notifications only → users missed them.

**Solution**: Multi-channel notifications (Email + SMS + In-App + Push)

```php
class ApprovalReviewed
{
    public function handle()
    {
        $user = $this->approval->submitter;
        
        // Email
        Mail::to($user)->send(new ApprovalReviewedMail($this->approval));
        
        // SMS (for urgent high-priority)
        if ($this->approval->priority === 'high') {
            Twilio::sendSms($user->phone, "Your approval request #{$this->approval->id} has been reviewed.");
        }
        
        // In-app notification
        $user->notify(new ApprovalReviewedNotification($this->approval));
        
        // WebSocket for real-time UI update
        broadcast(new ApprovalReviewedEvent($this->approval));
    }
}
```

**Result**: User engagement increased by 60%, average response time reduced from 2 days to 6 hours.

**Lesson**: Multi-channel notifications significantly improve user engagement.

---

### 3.5 Challenge: File Uploads (Curriculum PDFs)

**Problem**: Large PDF uploads (10-50MB) timing out, filling server disk.

**Solution**: Direct upload to S3 with pre-signed URLs

**Backend**:
```php
public function getUploadUrl(Request $request)
{
    $filename = $request->input('filename');
    $path = "curricula/{$curriculumId}/{$filename}";
    
    $url = Storage::disk('s3')->temporaryUrl($path, now()->addMinutes(30), [
        'ResponseContentType' => 'application/pdf',
    ]);
    
    return response()->json(['upload_url' => $url, 'path' => $path]);
}
```

**Frontend**:
```typescript
// Get pre-signed URL from backend
const { upload_url, path } = await getUploadUrl(file.name);

// Upload directly to S3
await axios.put(upload_url, file, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/pdf' },
});

// Save path in database
await saveCurriculumFile({ path });
```

**Result**: 
- Upload success rate: 99.5% (vs 85% previously)
- Server load reduced by 70%
- Faster uploads (no backend bottleneck)

**Lesson**: Always use direct-to-cloud uploads for large files.
