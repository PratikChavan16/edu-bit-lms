# 🎯 QUICK START - PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT

**For**: 2 Developers splitting 14 portals  
**Goal**: Zero merge conflicts  
**Timeline**: 13 weeks parallel work

---

## 📋 TL;DR - WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### Week 1: Foundation (BOTH TOGETHER) ⚡ CRITICAL!

Create these **5 shared contract files** FIRST:

```
brain/shared_contracts/  🆕 NEW FOLDER
├── api_response_formats.yaml   (Dev A - Half day)
├── shared_types.ts             (Dev B - Half day)
├── shared_enums.yaml           (Dev A - Half day)
├── error_codes.yaml            (Dev B - Half day)
└── integration_events.yaml     (Dev A - Half day)
```

Update these **4 master files**:

```
brain/
├── master_db_schema.sql           (Dev A - 1 day) ✏️ ADD views & indexes
├── master_roles_permissions.yaml  (Dev B - 1 day) ✏️ ADD new permissions
├── master_api_gateway.yaml        (Dev A - 1 day) ✏️ ADD hierarchical routes
└── master_auth_system.md          (Dev B - 1 day) ✏️ ADD God Mode auth
```

**Total: 6.5 days split between 2 = ~4 days in parallel**

## 🔑 CRITICAL CONTRACTS (Prevent Merge Conflicts)

### 1. Database Migrations - Number Ranges
```php
// Developer A: 100000-199999
2025_10_27_100001_add_university_hub_view.php
2025_10_27_100002_add_hierarchical_indexes.php

// Developer B: 200000-299999
2025_10_27_200001_add_college_stats_view.php
2025_10_27_200002_add_college_indexes.php
```

### 2. API Routes - Prefixes
```php
// Developer A - Bitflow Admin
Route::prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    // All routes here
});

// Developer B - University Owner
Route::prefix('university-owner')->group(function () {
    // All routes here
});
```

### 3. Frontend Apps - Folders
```
frontend/apps/
├── bitflow-admin/        (Developer A - FULL CONTROL)
└── university-owner/     (Developer B - FULL CONTROL)
```

**NO OVERLAP = NO CONFLICTS!** ✅

## ✅ PRE-START CHECKLIST

Before splitting work:

- [ ] Created `brain/shared_contracts/` folder
- [ ] Created all 5 shared contract files
- [ ] Updated all 4 master files
- [ ] Created Git branches (dev-a, dev-b)
- [ ] Agreed on migration numbering (100000 vs 200000)
- [ ] Agreed on API prefixes (/admin vs /university-owner)
- [ ] Setup ESLint + Prettier + PHP CS Fixer
- [ ] Brain folder documentation updated

**Once complete → Start parallel development with ZERO conflicts!** 🚀

---

## 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS (Weekly Sync)

Meet **Monday, Wednesday, Friday** to sync:

**Monday**: Planning & contract review
- Review any changes to shared contracts
- Plan week's work

**Wednesday**: Mid-week check
- Show progress
- Discuss blockers

**Friday**: Code review & merge
- Review each other's PRs
- Merge to main weekly

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### ✅ DO:
1. Use `shared_types.ts` for ALL types
2. Use `api_response_formats.yaml` for ALL API responses
3. Use `shared_enums.yaml` for ALL enum values
4. Weekly sync meetings (don't skip!)
5. Daily `git pull origin main`

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Modify shared contracts without approval
2. Skip tests ("will add later")
3. Work on each other's assigned portals
4. Skip brain folder documentation updates
5. Commit directly to main
