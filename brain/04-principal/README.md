## Portal Identity

**Principal** is the college head responsible for all academic, administrative, and operational activities within a single college. The Principal bridges university-level policies (from University Owner/Super Admin) with college-level execution.

**Core Responsibilities**:
- College operations management
- Department oversight
- Faculty management & evaluation
- Student discipline & grievances
- Academic quality assurance
- Budget management (college-level)
- Infrastructure planning
- Performance monitoring

**Key Distinction**: 
- **University Owner** = Multi-college strategic decisions
- **Super Admin** = University-wide operational setup
- **Principal** = Single college execution & management
- **HOD** = Department-specific operations (reports to Principal)
