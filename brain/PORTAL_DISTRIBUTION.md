## 🎯 Why This Distribution?

### Developer A (Academic Track) Rationale:
1. **Bitflow Admin** is the platform foundation - needs to be built first
2. **Super Admin** manages overall university operations
3. **Principal** manages college-level academics
4. **Super Academics** coordinates academic programs
5. **Faculty/Teacher** handles teaching operations
6. **Student** is the primary end-user for academics
7. **Parent** is lightweight and completes the academic flow

**Key Theme:** Academic workflow from top to bottom

---

### Developer B (Business Track) Rationale:
1. **University Owner** is the university-level superuser - parallel to Bitflow Admin
2. **College Admin** handles college-level administration
3. **Admission Admin** manages student intake (business operation)
4. **Super Accountant** handles university finances

## 🔗 Integration Points (Where Developers Collaborate)

### Critical Integration #1: God Mode Hierarchy API
**What:** Hierarchical navigation endpoints  
**Owner:** Developer A (Bitflow Admin)  
**Consumer:** Developer B (University Owner)  
**Contract:** `brain/shared_contracts/api_response_formats.yaml` → `hierarchical_navigation`  
**Timeline:** Week 2-3 (after Bitflow Admin hierarchy API is ready)

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET /api/hierarchy/universities
GET /api/hierarchy/colleges/:university_id
GET /api/hierarchy/departments/:college_id
```

**Action Items:**
- Developer A creates endpoints (Week 2)
- Developer B consumes endpoints (Week 3)
- Both test integration (Week 3, Friday)

---

### Critical Integration #2: User Management
**What:** User creation, roles, permissions  
**Owner:** Developer A (Super Admin)  
**Consumer:** All portals  
**Contract:** `brain/shared_contracts/shared_types.ts` → `User` interface  
**Timeline:** Week 4 (after Super Admin is ready)

**Integration Events:**
```
user.created
user.updated
user.role_changed
user.deleted
```

**Action Items:**
- Developer A implements user CRUD (Week 4)
- Developer B integrates user data in their portals (Week 5+)
- Both test event emission/consumption (Week 5, Friday)

---

### Critical Integration #3: Student Enrollment
**What:** Student admission → enrollment → course assignment  
**Owner:** Developer B (Admission Admin)  
**Consumer:** Developer A (Student, Faculty portals)  
**Contract:** `brain/shared_contracts/integration_events.yaml` → `student.enrolled`  
**Timeline:** Week 8 (after Admission Admin is ready)

**Integration Flow:**
1. Admission Admin creates student → emits `student.enrolled` event
2. Student portal receives event → creates dashboard
3. Faculty portal receives event → adds to course rosters

**Action Items:**
- Developer B emits event on enrollment (Week 8)
- Developer A listens and updates Student portal (Week 9)
- Both test end-to-end flow (Week 9, Friday)

---

### Critical Integration #4: Payment Processing
**What:** Fee payment → receipt generation → accounting  
**Owner:** Developer B (College Fee Admin)  
**Consumer:** Developer A (Student, Parent) & Developer B (Super Accountant)  
**Contract:** `brain/shared_contracts/integration_events.yaml` → `payment.received`  
**Timeline:** Week 11 (after Fee Admin is ready)

**Integration Flow:**
1. Student/Parent makes payment
2. Fee Admin processes → emits `payment.received`
3. Super Accountant updates ledger
4. Student/Parent portal shows receipt

**Action Items:**
- Developer B emits payment events (Week 11)
- Developer A shows payment status in Student/Parent portals (Week 11)
- Developer B updates accounting (Week 11)
- All test together (Week 12, Friday)

## 🛠️ Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention:
```
Developer A:
- feature/portal-01-bitflow-admin
- feature/portal-03-super-admin
- feature/portal-04-principal
- etc.

Developer B:
- feature/portal-02-university-owner
- feature/portal-05-college-admin
- feature/portal-10-admission-admin
- etc.
```

### Merge Strategy:
1. **Daily:** Commit to your feature branch
2. **Wednesday:** Push feature branch, create draft PR
3. **Friday:** Merge to `develop` after integration testing
4. **Next Monday:** Pull latest `develop` before starting new portal

### Conflict Resolution:
- **Shared contracts:** Never merge without both approving
- **Master files:** Discuss in standup before modifying
- **Portal-specific files:** No conflicts (separate folders)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Shared Contract Changes**
**Mitigation:**
- Lock contracts after Week 2
- Any changes require both approvals
- Update version numbers
- Communicate in standup

### **Risk 2: API Integration Delays**
**Mitigation:**
- Mock APIs initially
- Integration checkpoints every Friday
- Document API contracts clearly
- Test early and often

### **Risk 3: Event Schema Mismatches**
**Mitigation:**
- Use `integration_events.yaml` as single source of truth
- Validate event payloads with schemas
- Log all events for debugging
- Test event flows in Week 3, 9, 12

### **Risk 4: Developer Availability**
**Mitigation:**
- Communicate absences in advance
- Document current work state
- Async updates via Slack/Discord
- Pair programming for critical integrations
