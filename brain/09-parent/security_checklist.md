## 1. Authentication & Authorization Security

### Parent Authentication

- [ ] School-generated unique linking codes (7-day validity)
- [ ] Admin approval required for manual linking requests
- [ ] Document verification (Aadhar, birth certificate) for non-code links
- [ ] Max 4 parents per student (prevent unauthorized access)
- [ ] Audit trail for all linking/unlinking events
- [ ] Notification to other parents when new parent linked
- [ ] Cooling period: 24 hours before link becomes active (fraud prevention)

### Token Security
- [ ] JWT RS256 algorithm (asymmetric encryption)
- [ ] Short-lived access tokens (2 hours)
- [ ] Long-lived refresh tokens (90 days, mobile only)
- [ ] Token rotation on refresh (single-use refresh tokens)

- [ ] JTI (JWT ID) for blacklisting compromised tokens
- [ ] Secure storage: HttpOnly cookies (web), Keychain/Keystore (mobile)

---

## 2. Data Privacy & FERPA Compliance

### Child Data Access Control
- [ ] Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Parents can only access their linked children's data
- [ ] Time-based access expiration for temporary guardians
- [ ] Granular permissions per child (view grades, view fees, etc.)
- [ ] Separate permission for sensitive data (medical, disciplinary)

### PII Protection
- [ ] AES-256-GCM encryption for PII at rest
- [ ] TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- [ ] Tokenization for payment card data (PCI DSS)
- [ ] Encrypted backups with separate encryption keys
- [ ] Data minimization: Only collect necessary information
- [ ] Right to erasure: Parent can request data deletion
- [ ] Data portability: Export all data in JSON/PDF format

### FERPA Compliance
- [ ] Consent obtained before sharing educational records
- [ ] Directory information consent separate from academic records
- [ ] Disclosure log for third-party data sharing
- [ ] Annual reminders about privacy rights
- [ ] Secure destruction of records after student graduation
- [ ] Access logs showing who viewed which child's data

## 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

### Frontend Validation
- [ ] Mobile number: `^\\+\\d{1,3}-\\d{10}$` pattern
- [ ] OTP: Exactly 6 digits, no special characters
- [ ] Email: RFC 5322 compliant validation
- [ ] File uploads: Whitelist extensions (PDF, JPG, PNG only)
- [ ] Max file size: 5MB for documents
- [ ] XSS prevention: DOMPurify for user-generated content
- [ ] SQL injection prevention: Parameterized queries only

### Backend Validation
- [ ] Laravel validation rules on all inputs
- [ ] CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
- [ ] Rate limiting per endpoint (see below)
- [ ] Request size limits (1MB for JSON, 5MB for uploads)
- [ ] Path traversal prevention in file downloads

---

## 4. Session & Cookie Security

### Session Management
- [ ] Idle timeout: 30min (web), 7 days (mobile)
- [ ] Absolute timeout: 8 hours (web), 90 days (mobile)
- [ ] Max 3 concurrent sessions per parent
- [ ] Session invalidation on password change
- [ ] Redis-based session storage with TTL
- [ ] Device fingerprint validation per session

### Cookie Security
- [ ] `HttpOnly` flag (prevent JavaScript access)
- [ ] `Secure` flag (HTTPS only)
- [ ] `SameSite=Strict` (CSRF protection)
- [ ] Short expiration for sensitive cookies
- [ ] Separate cookie domains per environment

---

## 5. API Security

### Rate Limiting
| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `/auth/register` | 5 req | 1 hour |
| `/auth/verify-otp` | 3 req | 5 min |
| `/children/search` | 20 req | 1 min |
| `/payments` | 10 req | 5 min |
| `/messages/send` | 30 req | 1 hour |

### API Security Headers
```nginx
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Whitelist only trusted origins
- [ ] Credentials allowed only for same-origin
- [ ] Preflight cache: 24 hours max

---

## 6. Payment Security (PCI DSS)

### Payment Gateway Integration
- [ ] Never store raw card details (use tokenization)
- [ ] Razorpay/PhonePe SDK for card processing
- [ ] 3D Secure (OTP) for card transactions
- [ ] UPI Intent flow (no credentials in app)
- [ ] Transaction amount verification before payment
- [ ] Double-spend prevention (idempotency keys)
- [ ] Webhook signature verification for payment callbacks
- [ ] Refund process with admin approval

### Payment Audit Trail
- [ ] Log all payment initiation attempts
- [ ] Log payment success/failure with reason
- [ ] Log refund requests and approvals
- [ ] Alert on suspicious payment patterns
- [ ] Monthly payment reconciliation reports
