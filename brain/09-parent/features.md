### User Stories
- **As a parent with 3 children**, I want to quickly switch between their profiles so that I can check each one's attendance without confusion
- **As a working parent**, I want to see a consolidated dashboard showing all my children's pending fees so that I can make one payment for all
- **As a guardian managing 2 siblings**, I want different permissions per child (view grades for older, only attendance for younger)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-MC-04**: Parent can set default child for quick access
- **FR-MC-05**: Quick actions available per child (view attendance, pay fees, message teacher)
- **FR-MC-06**: Permissions shall be granular per child (view_attendance, view_grades, make_payments)

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface ChildCard {
  student_id: string;
  name: string;
  class: string;
  color: 'blue' | 'pink' | 'purple' | 'green' | 'orange';
  photo_url: string;

  };
}
```
