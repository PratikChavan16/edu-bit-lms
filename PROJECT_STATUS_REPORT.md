## 📝 Recommendations

### For Project Manager
1. **Extend Timeline by 1 Week**
   - Current state: 72% backend, 30% frontend
   - Need: 3 days backend fixes + 4 days frontend pages + 3 days integration
   - Total: 10 working days

   - Student: Login → Dashboard → View Timetable → Submit Assessment
   - Faculty: Login → Mark Attendance → Create Assessment → View Library
   - Admin: Login → Manage Users → Verify Documents → View Analytics

3. **Consider Phased Launch**
   - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Authentication + Dashboard + Documents (READY)
   - **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Assessments + Library + Timetable
   - **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Fees + Attendance + Announcements

### For Development Team
1. **Backend:** Focus on fixing 36 failing tests before new features
2. **Frontend:** Build pages in order of user priority (Dashboard → Timetable → Assessments)
3. **DevOps:** Setup staging environment for integration testing

### For QA Team
1. Create test plans for each user role
2. Setup automated E2E tests with Playwright
3. Perform security audit (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
4. Load testing with 500 concurrent users
