## 🔗 API Architecture

### Client Structure
```
packages/api-client/src/
├── types.ts (all TypeScript interfaces)
├── learner/
│   ├── index.ts (exports)
│   ├── dashboard.ts (useLearnerDashboard)
│   ├── timetable.ts (useLearnerTimetable)
│   └── assessments.ts (3 hooks)
└── admin/ (future)
```

### Hook Patterns
```typescript
// Query Hook (Read)
useLearnerDashboard(options?: UseQueryOptions)

// Mutation Hook (Write)
useSubmitAssessment(options?: UseMutationOptions)

// With Filters
useLearnerAssessments(filters?: { status?: string }, options?)
```

### Error Handling
- Network errors: Show AlertCircle with retry button
- Loading states: Skeleton screens
- Empty states: User-friendly messages
- Validation errors: Inline field errors
