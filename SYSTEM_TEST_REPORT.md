### ❌ Test 3.2: Faculty Grading - Get Assessments
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/faculty/grading/assessments`  
**Authentication:** Bearer token (prof_sharma)

**Response:** ❌ **FAILED (500 Internal Server Error)**

**Error Analysis:**
```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 
1146 Table 'lms.assessments_faculty' doesn't exist
```

**Root Cause:**
The `GradingController` is trying to query a pivot table `assessments_faculty` that doesn't exist in the database schema. The system should use the `assessments.faculty_id` foreign key instead.

**Issue Location:** 
- File: `app/Http/Controllers/Faculty/GradingController.php`
- Line: ~49 (pagination query)

**Fix Required:**
The query in `GradingController::getAssessments()` is correctly using:
```php
Assessment::where('faculty_id', $faculty->id)
```

However, there may be a relationship issue in the Assessment model trying to load a many-to-many relationship that doesn't exist.

**Recommendation:** ⚠️
1. Check `Assessment` model for `faculty()` relationship
2. Ensure it's using `belongsTo` instead of `belongsToMany`
3. Remove any `assessments_faculty` pivot table references
4. The relationship should be: `Assessment belongsTo Faculty` (one-to-many)

## 👨‍👩‍👧 4. Parent Portal Tests

### ✅ Test 4.1: Get Children
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/parent/children`  
**Authentication:** Bearer token (bitflow_admin)

**Response:** ✅ **SUCCESS (200)**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": []
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Endpoint accessible
- ✅ Returns empty array (no parent-student relationships for admin user)
- ✅ Controller working correctly

**Note:** ⚠️
The endpoint works correctly but returns empty data because:
1. The admin user is not a parent
2. No parent-student relationships exist in demo data
3. Need to seed parent users and link them to students

**Recommendations:**
- Create parent users in seeder
- Link parents to students via `parent_student` table
- Test with actual parent credentials
